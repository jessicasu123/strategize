Demo Order:


* Start by showing off the features of your running program:
1. run the program through a planned series of steps/interactions (it will look much better if it this demo shows everyone's parts working together as a single program rather than multiple separate demos)
    * Demo Order:
        1. Start View 
            * Holly
        2. Game SetUp Options
            * Sanya
            * Talk about submit button
                * Controller
                    * Sanya
                * File Handler
                    * Brian
        3. Game View
            * Brian 
                * talk about visuals
            * Show make move
                * Sanya
                    * Controller 
                * Jessica 
                    * Board and Game (functionality when getting/making move)
                        * neighbors

                    * Game Piece

                    * Agent/Agent Player
                * Jessica 
                    * Game (sending update back to controller/GUI)
    
    * show any data files that have been created and describe how they are used within your program (focus on the file content rather than the code that uses it)
        1. GameCenterView → Holly
        2. GameSetUpOption → Sanya
        3. GameView → Brian
        4. Tic-tac-toe → Jessica
    * show a variety of JUnit or TestFX tests (including both happy and sad paths) and discuss how comprehensively they cover the feature(s) and why you chose the values used in the tests
        * Talk about//show one of our tests 
        * Show overall test coverage
    * everyone should be able to describe how their work relates to specific demoed features as they are shown
* Then present what you (or your team overall) learned during this Sprint and the implementation plan for the next Sprint:
    * describe how much of the planned features were completed this Sprint and what helped or impeded progress → Brian
        * All of features planned were completed
        * Still some room for feature enhancement 
        * Constant zoom meetings (at least once-twice a week), responsiveness on FB messenger, quick to offer help if needed 
    * describe a specific significant event that occurred this Sprint and what was learned from it → Jessica
        * Significant event  = thursday morning integrating all of the different parts of the program
            * Learned about importance of planning APIs
            * The benefits of modularity
    * describe what worked, what did not, and something specific that is planned for improvement next Sprint → Sanya
        * What worked
            * Very detailed planning & specific delegation of tasks 
            * Constant communication 
        * What did not
            * Think this sprint went pretty well? 
        * Improvement
            * Continued communication like having a designated midpoint meeting on monday/tuesday 
                * Recurring meeting on Thursday when each spring is due 
            * Communicating about progress/blockers regularly outside of meeting times as well
    * what features are planned to be completed during the next Sprint (taking into account what was done this Sprint), who will work on each feature, and any concerns that may complicate the plan → Holly
        * On track for next sprint because we completed all features for sprint 1 → will be no carry over
